World Layoffs Analysis (SQL) 
=> Project Overview:-
This project focuses on analyzing global layoffs across various industries, companies, and regions using SQL. The dataset contains information on layoffs, company details, industry classification, funding amounts, and more.

The objective of this analysis is to uncover trends such as:
+ Which companies had the highest layoffs?
+ What industries were most affected?
+ Which countries saw the most layoffs?
+ How did layoffs change over time?
+ Did funding amounts impact layoffs?

By performing data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA), this project provides key insights into the job market fluctuations and their impact on different sectors.

=> Dataset Description:-
The dataset contains the following key columns:

*Company – Name of the company that laid off employees.
*Industry – The sector the company belongs to (e.g., Tech, Finance, Consumer).
*Total Laid Off – Number of employees affected.
*Percentage Laid Off – Percentage of workforce affected.
*Date – Date of the layoffs.
*Funds Raised (in millions) – The total funding received by the company.
*Country – The country where layoffs occurred.

=>SQL Techniques Used:-
This project involved writing SQL queries to:
* Find the company with the highest layoffs.
* Identify industries most affected by layoffs.
* Find companies that shut down completely (100% layoffs).
* Analyze country-wise layoffs to determine the most impacted regions.
* Examine layoffs in highly funded companies to see if funding helped prevent job losses.
* Aggregate total layoffs by year to observe yearly trends.


++> Future Improvements:
    Visualizations – Use Power BI or Matplotlib to create charts for better insights.
    Predictive Analysis – Use Machine Learning to forecast layoffs based on past trends.
    Time-Series Analysis – Identify patterns over time to understand market downturns.

 ++>Tools Used:
    MySQL – For database management and querying.
    GitHub – For version control and project sharing.
